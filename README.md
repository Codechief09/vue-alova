## alova request strategy list

Alova is the core library, which provides common functions such as caching strategy, request sharing strategy, and state management, and can meet more than 99% of request requirements. At the same time, alova also provides business logic and frequently used request strategy hooks, which can be directly used in specific scenarios. The following is a list of request policy hooks provided by alova.

### More request-related business scenarios are being collected...

If you still have a specific and typical business request scene which we havn't implemented yet, you can [submit an issue](https://github.com/alovajs/scene/issues/new/choose) here, or you can also customize the request hook, please see the [Advanced](/category/advanced) section.

## Examples

[The examples here will show the power of alova.](https://alova.js.org/category/examples)

## What relationship with request libraries

The original intention of alova is to propose a solution for different request scenarios. It can implement request functions with better experience and performance more concisely and elegantly. It is an RSM implementation library, such as $.ajax, axios and fetch-api. It provides good support for request sending and response receiving. They are an indispensable part of the RSM process (request event link), and alova still needs to rely on them for requests, so we can regard alova as a request library. An armament that makes the request library even more powerful.

## Library Stability

It has been more then one year since the first version of alova. During this year, we have been continuously discovering and optimizing problems. So far, alova has passed 170+ unit tests, with a coverage rate of 99%. and it almost in a stable state. Even so, alova is still a rookie, it still has a large development space.

## We really need your star

If you like alova. we are very appreciate your star at the topright. it's a approval and encourage of our work.

## To replace other request libraries?

alova is a request strategy library, which was originally created to provide specific request strategy solutions for different request scenarios, so as to achieve a smooth request experience more concisely and elegantly, such as `$.ajax`, `axios` and `fetch- api`, etc. they has provided a good support for network communication, they are an essential link (request event) in the [RSM](https://alova.js.org/tutorial/get-started/RSM) process, alova still needs to depend them to send requests, Therefore, we can regard alova as an arm of the request library, making the request library more powerful.

## Why binding UI framework?

Decoupling a js library means using it in more scenarios. For example, axios can be used in nodejs, but it also means that developers need to write more template code, such as using useHooks to encapsulate axios. However, alova abandons more usage scenarios brought about by decoupling, and positions the scope of use in conjunction with the UI framework to use alova in the most streamlined way. This is for the benefit of developers and is prevalent in a UI framework. Sometimes, deep binding can provide developers with direct-use functions and improve the developer's experience without requiring too much template code.

## Size comparison with other libraries
